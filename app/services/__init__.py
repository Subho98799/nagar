"""
Services layer - Business logic goes here.
Keep services focused on specific domains (alerts, reports, etc.)

DESIGN PRINCIPLE:
- Services contain business logic, NOT routes
- AI assistance logic will live here (when added)
- Human-in-the-loop checks will be service-level decisions
- No automated escalation to authorities
"""

# Placeholder for future services
# Examples (DO NOT implement yet):
# - alert_service.py: Alert processing and interpretation assistance
# - report_service.py: Citizen report handling
# etc.
